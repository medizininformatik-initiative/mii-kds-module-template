### Introduction

This specification describes the FHIR representation of the Core Dataset (CDS) module **Module Template** of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII). It covers the module's use cases and the associated FHIR profiles, extensions and terminology resources in their normative form. The MII Core Dataset enables the standardized secondary use of routine clinical data for medical research.

> [TODO: In one or two sentences, describe what your module covers and what the data is used for.]

### Target audience

##### Implementers

Data Integration Centers (DIC), software developers and system architects building FHIR-based solutions.
 → see [Profiles](profiles.md) and [Logical Models](logical-models.md).

##### Researchers

Scientists using KDS data for medical research.
 → see [Guidance for Researchers](researcher-guidance.md).

### Contents

* **[Guidance](guidance.md)** — getting started and domain notes.
* **Conformance** — the KDS-wide conformance rules (requirements language, Must Support, handling missing data) are maintained centrally by the [Meta module](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/kerndatensatz-meta/wiki/Conformance); the module-specific [Security and Privacy](security-and-privacy.md) considerations are part of this guide.
* **[Profiles](profiles.md)** and the further **[artifact pages](artifacts.md)** — the technical artifacts.
* **[Examples](examples.md)** — example instances.
* **[Dependencies](ImplementationGuide-mii-ig-template.md)** — the ImplementationGuide resource with the dependency table, cross-version analysis and copyright statements.
